# OLTP + OLAP Integration

# Project Overview

This project, completed for DSA 2040A – 2025 Lab2, focuses on building a retail data pipeline that integrates OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems using MySQL. The objective of the project is to simulate a real-world retail setup by designing a transactional schema, transforming data into a star schema, running analytical queries, and documenting key insights.

The project is based on the extended lab manual “OLTP + OLAP Integration for Retail Analytics” and includes the following components:


 - OLTP schema design for real-time data capture

 -  OLAP star schema construction for reporting and analysis

 - CSV data import 

 - ETL process from OLTP to OLAP using SQL

 - Analytical SQL queries for business insights

 - Documentation via a structured GitHub repository

 ##  Project Structure
 
- `/oltp_schema/`: Contains the transactional schem
  
- `/olap_schema/`: Contains the star schema
  
- `/etl_scripts/`: SQL for ETL operations
  
- `/sample_data/`: Placeholder for CSV files (optional)
  
- `/queries/`: SQL queries for business analytics

  # Reflection Questions:
  
1. Why is the OLTP system normalized and the OLAP system denormalized?
   
2. What challenges would you face if you ran analytical queries directly on the OLTP
system?

3. How can automation (e.g., scheduled ETL jobs) help in a real-world data
pipeline?
